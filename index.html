        <p>The <b>Smithsonian National Museum of American History</b>tells the story of the US since 
            settlers arrived from Europe, with exhibitions covering the <b>social, political, scientific, 
                cultural and military history of the country</b>. The exhibitions give an interesting look 
            at the building of a nation and how this changed the world at large during its comparatively 
            short history.</p>
