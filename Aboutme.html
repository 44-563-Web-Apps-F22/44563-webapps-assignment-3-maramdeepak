    <p>Badri</p>
    <p>
        Badri (Pawan Kalyan) is an ad agency director whose parents are settled in the USA. 
        His girlfriend, Vennela (Renu Desai), is a close friend of Badri's family. Their parents want these two to tie the knot. 
        Badri and Vennela are whiling away time, as Vennela did not finish her graduation yet.</p>
